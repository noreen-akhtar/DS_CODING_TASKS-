// 3. Suppose you have an array of objects:

// let books = [

// {

// name: ‘The Lean Startup’,

// topics: [‘entrepreneurship’,’startups’],

// },

// {

// name: ‘War and Peace’,

// topics: [‘peace’, ‘politics’],

// }];

// Now you need to print the name and topics separately, how would you do that?

        topics: ["peace", "politics"],
    }];

    console.log(books[i].name);
    console.log(books[i].topics);
